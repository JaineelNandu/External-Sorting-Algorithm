# External-Sorting-Algorithm
Project Completion Date: November 2020

**In this project we implement an External Sorting Algorithm that reads data from the Secondary storage device and sorts it with respect to a key value. The goal of this project is to learn to read data from the hard drive and implement a heap sort with limited memory, and mergesort.** _Refer Project\_Specification.pdf for details_

Project done as a requirement for Virginia Tech Course CS5040: Intermediate Data Structures & Algorithms.

**_Note: You cannot directly use this code, implementation details are hidden so as to not violate the Honor Code_**

**Honor Code Declaration**

_On my honor:_

- _I have not used source code obtained from another student, or any other unauthorized source, either modified or unmodified._
- _All source code and documentation used in my program is either my original work, or was derived by me from the source code published in the textbook for this course._
- _I have not discussed coding details about this project with anyone other than my partner (in the case of a joint submission), instructor, ACM/UPE tutors or the TAs assigned to this course. I understand that I may discuss the concepts of this program with other students, and that another student may help me debug my program so long as neither of us writes anything during the discussion or modifies any computer file during the discussion. I have violated neither the spirit nor letter of this restriction._
